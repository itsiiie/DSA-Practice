# ðŸ§  Quick Revision Key Points:
# min_price â†’ Track the best buying price so far.

# max_profit â†’ Track the best profit possible so far.

# Always buy before you sell (i.e., maintain the order in the array).

# Time Complexity: O(n) â†’ One loop through the array.

# Let me know if you want a commented version of the multiple transactions variant too (Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II).
